# RADAR Framework for Product Strategy Review

## Overview

RADAR is an AI-powered framework for evaluating product proposals against organizational strategy using four key lenses.

## The Four RADAR Lenses

### 1. Visibility
**Question: Is this theme visible across leadership reviews and other teams' initiatives?**

- **What it measures**: Organizational awareness and coordination (NOT strategic fit)
- **Key indicators**:
  - Theme appears in leadership discussions and meeting notes
  - Other teams have similar initiatives or are working on related problems
  - Organizational awareness of this problem space exists
  - Coordination opportunities or potential conflicts with existing work

### 2. Alignment
**Question: Does it connect clearly to the strategy and OKRs?**

- **What it measures**: Documented strategic connection (NOT organizational awareness)
- **Key indicators**:
  - Direct, specific connection to written OKRs and key results
  - Alignment with documented company strategy documents
  - Connection to stated business priorities and goals
  - Resource allocation matches strategic importance level

### 3. Confidence
**Question: Are the assumptions valid, and do the leading indicators tie back to lagging KPIs?**

- **What it measures**: Assumption validity and metric reliability
- **Key indicators**:
  - Validity of underlying assumptions with supporting evidence
  - Quality of leading indicators and their predictive power
  - Clear connection between leading indicators and lagging KPIs
  - Risk factors and assumption testing methodology

### 4. User Problems
**Question: Is the opportunity anchored in real user research and feedback?**

- **What it measures**: User validation and problem-solution fit
- **Key indicators**:
  - Quality and recency of user research supporting the opportunity
  - Specific user feedback and evidence cited
  - Problem validation through actual user data
  - User impact and value proposition strength

## Scoring System

Each lens is scored from 1-10:

- **1-3**: Critical issues - Proposal should be paused or significantly revised
- **4-6**: Moderate concerns - Proceed with caution, address issues first
- **7-10**: Strong score - Good to proceed

## Overall Recommendation

The overall score is the average of all four lenses, with recommendations:

- **7-10**: PROCEED - Strong strategic fit
- **5-6.9**: PROCEED WITH CAUTION - Address concerns first
- **1-4.9**: PAUSE - Significant issues to resolve

## AI Agent Implementation

Each lens is evaluated by a specialized AI agent that:

1. Analyzes the proposal against its specific criteria
2. Reviews relevant organizational documents
3. Provides specific findings with evidence
4. Recommends next steps for improvement
5. Scores the proposal on a 1-10 scale

The agents work together to provide comprehensive analysis while maintaining focus on their specialized areas.
